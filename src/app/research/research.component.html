  Alterations of in vivo molecular properties, such as intracellular pH and protein/metabolite concentrations, are known to underlie a  variety of neurological diseases, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and cancer. Importantly, pathology-related effects at the molecular level are manifested long before any anatomical or structural changes occur and may also reflect the host response to therapeutics. Therefore, <b> non-invasive imaging of molecular processes </b> is a pivotal tool for achieving early diagnosis and could play a crucial role in the optimization of therapeutic approaches.

      <p align="justify">
        We develop tools for disentangling the different signals coming from brain metabolites, proteins, and lipids, and evaluate their potential to serve as noninvasive image bio-markers for cell death, ischemia, and disease severity.     </p>

      <p align="justify"> We design and implement AI-based methods for early interventions along  the imaging pipeline, enabling automatic MRI acquisition protocol discovery and quantitative molecular parameters reconstruction. This allows for a drastic reduction in scan time and compatibility with a variety of biological scenarios.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Noninvasive image monitoring of treatment response</h1>
      <p align="justify">While conventional imaging provides anatomical information that reflects the treatment resopnse to therapy at a relatively late stage (e.g., in the form of tumor shrinkage), molecular MRI has the potential to inform the physician about the treatment response (or the lack of it) much earlier. This is crucial for optimizing novel therapeutic modalities, and for providing precision medicine. We investigate the suitability of particular brain metabolites to serve as early indicators of treatment response for a variety of pathologies.</p>

      <p align="justify">We investigate the use of deep neural-networks and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) for rapid extraction of quantitative maps from chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) signals. Such quantitative parameters may improve the reproduciblity and robustness of  molecular MRI, and facilitate its clinical acceptance.</p>
